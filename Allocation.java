    <div align="center"><h2>HOLY TOUCH OF MUMBAI...!</h2></div>	
    <p><b>Siddhivinayak Temple</b>Have a wish that you want granted?<br>
 Visit the famous Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai, devoted to Lord Ganesh.<br>
 While many Hindu temples only allow Hindus to enter, thereby adding to the religion's mystery, this temple welcomes everyone with its open door policy.<br> 
Visitors shouldn'st expect a peaceful experience however. On an average day, the temple draws over 25,000 people.<br> 
Every Tuesday, the most auspicious day of the week, this number swells to over 100,000 people.<br>
 From Monday evening, the crowd starts swarming around the temple and lining up in anticipation of Tuesday's 4.45am holy aarti (prayer).
<br><div align="center"><img src ="siddhivinayak1.jpg" width=400 height=275 border=5></div></p><br><br>
<p><b>Mount Mary's Basilica :</b>As the name suggests, Mount Mary's Basilica sits atop a small hill overlooking the ocean.<br> 
Its current semi-Gothic style building is around 100 years old, although the statue of the mother Mary dates back to the 16th century.<br>
The church and its grounds are particularly festive during the Bandra Fair. <br>
It takes place over an eight day period, starting on the first Sunday after September 8, as part of the annual Feast of Our Lady of the Mount celebrations.
<br><div align="center"><img src ="mount mary.jpg" width=400 height=275 border=5></div></p><br><br>
<p><b>Babu Amichand Panalal Adishwarji Jain Temple:</b> Jain temples are usually the most elaborate ones in India, and the Babu Amichand Panalal Adishwarji temple is no exception.<br>
 Built in 1904, it's adorned with colorful ornate sculptures and paintings.<br>
 The entrance has two stone elephants on either side of it.<br>
 Inside, the dome ceiling is resplendent with the signs of the zodiac.<br>
 As its name suggests, the temple is Lord Adishwar (also known as Rushabhdev), the first of 24 Jain "Tirthankaras" (special liberated souls who have attained omniscience, and guide other souls from the cycle of death and rebirth) of the current era.<br>
<div align="center"><img src ="jain temple.jpg" border=5></div></p><br><br>
<p><b>Mahalaxmi Temple:</b> As its name suggests, Mahalaxmi Temple is devoted to the Goddess Mahalaxmi (the Great Laxmi, goddess of wealth and prosperity).<br>
One of the oldest temples in Mumbai, Mahalaxmi Temple was built in 1782 to bring good fortune and remove problems that were hampering the Hornby Vellard causeway construction project.<br>
Take the long flight of steps, lined with with vendors selling everything from sweets to saris, up to the temple from the Arabian Sea.<br> 
<div align="center"><img src ="mahalaxmi temple.jpg" width=400 height=275 border=5></div></p><br><br>
<p><b>Haji Ali:</b> One of the top 10 attractions in Mumbai, the imposing Haji Ali is both a mosque and tomb.<br>
 It was built in 1431 by wealthy Muslim merchant and Sufi saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, who was inspired to change the course of his life after going to Mecca.<br>
 It also contains his body. Situated in the middle of the ocean, Haji Ali is only accessible during low tide from a narrow, 500 yard long walkway.<br>
 On Thursdays and Fridays tens of thousands of pilgrims flock there to receive blessings from the dead saint.<br>
 If find you need to pass some time until the tide lowers enough, there's a shopping center on the opposite side of the road.<br>
 Unfortunately, women are no longer permitted to enter the shrine's inner sanctum. <br>
 However, they can still visit its large open area.<br>
